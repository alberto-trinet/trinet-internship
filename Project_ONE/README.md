# Internship Project - Custom HTML and CSS Development

Welcome to the first internship project! In this project, you will be creating a custom HTML file and applying CSS styling to replicate a given wireframe and design mockup. This project will help you enhance your front-end development skills and provide valuable experience in translating design concepts into functional web pages.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to take the provided wireframe / design mockup and use them as a reference to create a fully functional and responsive HTML webpage. Additionally, you will need to apply the necessary CSS styling to ensure that the final output matches the given design.
