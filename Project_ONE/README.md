The developer overlooking your internship should confirm what is the appropriate mockup to follow. 

## Project Tasks

1. **Review the Wireframe / Design Mockup:** Start by carefully examining the wireframe and design mockup provided. Pay attention to the layout, positioning of elements, colors, fonts, and any other design details.

2. **Create the HTML File:** Using the wireframe as a reference, build the structure of the HTML page. Ensure that all elements are appropriately nested and that the HTML follows best practices for accessibility and semantic markup.

3. **Integrate Assets:** Place all provided image files and other assets into the appropriate locations within your HTML structure. Use relative paths to ensure the project remains portable.

4. **Apply CSS Styling:** Use the design mockup as a guide to create a corresponding CSS file. Apply the necessary styles to achieve the desired look and layout. Ensure that your CSS adheres to best practices, such as using classes and IDs judiciously and organizing styles logically.

5. **Responsiveness:** Make the webpage responsive by using CSS media queries and other responsive techniques. Test your page on various screen sizes and devices to ensure it adapts well.
