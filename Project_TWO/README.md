# Project Two - Catalog Page

The main purpose of project two is to get better experience with Javascript and JQuery. So when working on this assignment do not worry too much about your css styling. Styling should come at the very end if you have completed the minimum requirements for this project before the deadline assigned by your supervising dev.

Replicate a catalog page of some sort, it does not have to be specifically ecommerce based, it can be a library catalog, it can be information based, providing info on your favorite characters in a video game , the possiblities are endless. 

Some examples are,

- a video game character catalog
- Reading book catalog
- Product catalog

Here are links to good examples of what is expected:
- https://app.mobalytics.gg/valorant/agents
- https://zakarya-mks.github.io/my-library/
- https://calastudios.shop/collections/fall-mousepads

The main purpose of this project is to use javascript/jquery to have an interactive page for the user to play with. With this catalog you should be able to incorporate filters , sorting and even a create/delete item functionality. 

### Minimum requirments 
- Use an array to store your item objects , will make it easier for sorting and customizing later
- Item creation form / input
  Ex: https://zakarya-mks.github.io/my-library/
  Does a good example of showing a book catalog which you can add new books to.
  
- Have at least a minimum of 3 fields within your respective items, using the book example this could be , "Title" , "Author", "Page Count", etc.
- 3 minimum sorting options , if you have sort by name "A - Z" and "Z - A" , that only counts as one
- One filter option, this is dealer's choice based on item categories but feel free to put as many as you think would work with your items
  Ex: https://app.mobalytics.gg/valorant/agents
  uses two simple filters to show different character types and difficutly

### Bonus items (if time permits):
- Edit item info (indivdual item edit)
- Delete an item
- Accept images as an input / Show item images
- Search bar

If you have any questions about this then please refer to the supervising developer who can assist you and guide you in the right direction. One thing to note for both the intern and the supervising developer, the above is a simple guideline to follow, it is up to the supervising developer to determine if the above requirements are necessary or require some updating. So feel free to alter the requierments based on the situation.
