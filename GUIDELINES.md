# Trinet Internship Program Guidlines

## Overview

You will be jumping between various readings/resources and then completing projects based on the recent materials you learned. 

Below is a general overview of what is to be completed. If you feel that there are items you are unprepared for , feel free to ask for help , the team will be happy to supply additional resources. The same goes if you feel that you are not being challenged. If there are aspects you find that you already know , talk to the dev team and they will assist in moving you further into the curriculm or providing different material.
